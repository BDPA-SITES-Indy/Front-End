Activity: CSS Monster

Use css to create an image of a creature! This activity consists of two parts:

1. An html file that includes the pieces of your monster.
2. A stylesheet (css document) that determines how each piece of your image is styled, positioned, colored, etc.

Your creation should be original.
Your stylesheet should be referenced externally.
