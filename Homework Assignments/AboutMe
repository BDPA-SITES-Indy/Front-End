About Me Assignment:

Project Setup:

1.Create a new directory (folder) on your computer called “me”.
Place HTML and image files associated with your new website inside of this directory.
The home page of your new website should be named “index.html”.
Other pages can be named as you like, but should reflect the content of the page.
Remember that all file and directory names should be limited to letters, numbers,
and dashes and be lowercase, with no spaces.

Your Website:

Three HTML web pages—about you—form the heart of the current assignment.
Any combination of your background, interests, or experiences will do as long as it is autobiographical.
You are to write these pages using Atom.

Website Requirements:
-There should be semantic text elements on each page, including but not limited to paragraph (<p>) and heading (<h1>, <h2>, etc.) text.
-The pages should link to each other with “relative” URLs.
-Each page should also include at least one “absolute” URL linking to an external website.
-You should include at least one image (JPG, PNG, GIF, or SVG) on each page.
-All img elements should include src, width, height, and alt attributes with appropriate values.
-You should include an HTML list somewhere on one of your pages; this can be an ordered, unordered, or description list.
-There should be semantic section elements on each page, including but not limited to <main>, <header>, and <footer>.
