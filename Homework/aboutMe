Three HTML web pages—about you—form the heart of the current assignment. Any combination of your background, interests, or experiences will do as long as it is autobiographical. You are to write these pages using a plain text editor such as Atom. The focus of this assignment is on describing web page content with HTML; refrain from styling the pages until the next assignment, CSS.

Here is a list of required elements you should include in these pages.

1. There should be semantic text elements on each page, including but not limited to paragraph (<p>) and heading (<h1>, <h2>, etc.) text.
2. The pages should link to each other with “relative” URLs.
3. Each page should also include at least one “absolute” URL linking to an external website.
4. You should include at least one image (JPG, PNG, GIF, or SVG) on each page. (We’ve not covered image editing yet but feel free to use images from your camera or smartphone as well as images downloaded from the web.)
5. All img elements should include src, width, height, and alt attributes with appropriate values.
6. You should include an HTML list somewhere on one of your pages; this can be an ordered, unordered, or description list.
7. There should be semantic section elements on each page, including but not limited to <main>, <header>, and <footer>.
*Pay close attention to your HTML tags and be sure to test your pages locally in an up-to-date web browser as you code them. You can also check your HTML code using the W3C Markup Validation Service.
