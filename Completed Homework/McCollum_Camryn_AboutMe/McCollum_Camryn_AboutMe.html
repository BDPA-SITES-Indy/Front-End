<h2> My Life Story </h2>
<p>My name is Camryn McCollum and I'm 13 years old.  My birthday is Janurary 26th.  I was born in Indianapolis, IN.  When I was about 10 months old, we moved to South Carolina. My sister was born there on Janurary 7th, 2009.  When I was around 2 years old, we moved again to Tennessee.  We lived in Nashville, Tennessee.  Tennessee has to be my favorite place I've lived.  We lived there for about 5 years.  After those 5 years we moved back to Indianapolis, IN.  I really miss Tennessee, and me and my sister always beg my parents to move back.    </p>
<h3>School</h3>
<p> I go to Avon Middle School South, and I am in 7th grade.  My favorite class is FACS (Family and Consumer Sciences) because we get to make food, and we get to learn how to sew.  I also like Language Arts because I like reading. </p>
<h4> What Class Am I In?</h4>
<p> I am in the front-end class here at BDPA. It's fun because we get to learn how to build a website. I also like the challenge of coding.  Sometimes you have to try things over and over again until you get it right.  It kind of reminds me of a puzzle.  </p>
