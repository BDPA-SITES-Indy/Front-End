<h2> Favorite Color </h2>
<p> To be honest, my favorite color changes a lot.  Right now my favorite color is blue-green.  I think the color is very pretty. I also really like the color orange.  Whenever I see the color it makes me happy.     </p>

<p> My favorite food is pizza.  I only like cheese pizza and sometimes I'll eat pepperoni pizza if there's no cheese. My favorite dessert is brownies.  I like baking them a lot at home.  They are pretty easy to make, and they are very good.  My favorite breakfast food is waffles.  Belgian waffles are my favorite.  They are really good if you put syrup or whipped cream on them.</p>
<h4> Favorite Sport </h4>
<p> My favorite sport is volleyball.  I really like the competitiveness of the sport, and I like blocking the ball.  I also like track because I'm really fast, and I like to run. </p>
<h5> Favorite Animal </h5>
<p> My favorite animal is a dog. Dogs have a special place in my heart. They are fun to cuddle with and play with.  Below you will see some of the dogs I've had. </p>
