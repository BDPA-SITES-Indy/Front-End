  Hi everyone, thanks for coming to the family section of my webpage!
My family is all over the place from the islands to New York. But today we are going to talk about the family that I live with.
My dad, Carlos Perkins is the pastor of <a href="https://www.bethelcathedral.org/" target="_blank"> bethel cathedral</a>
and is a former principal.
My mom, Carla Perkins is a social worker for <a href="https://myips.org/georgewashington/staff-directory/" target="_blank"> george washington</a>
My mom is also a therapist for <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/carla-s-perkins-indianapolis-in/67241" target="_blank">psychology today.</a>.</p>
<p>My brother, Jebron Perkins is a very smart young man he is 16 and is about to go to <a href="https://wustl.edu/" target='_blank'> washu</a> to graduate in the
 class of 2024!
Last but not least me.
I am Jemila Perkins. I dance and do gymnastics!
And we can't forget about our dog............. Cobi!

As a family we have lived many places such as
<ul>
<li> Maryland</li>
<li>St.Croix</li>

</ul>

And that's a little about my family!
