    <p>
   some experiences I've had in technology were in third grade I went
    to a 3d printing class in 5th grade I went to a coding class that was
    informative. later in sixth grade summer I went to a camp the first week
    wasn't that great because the teacher just let anyone do anything but the
    second week it was more coordinated and we got more things done
